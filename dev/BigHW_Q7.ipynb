    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Coding is one specific part in programming where you actually write your program's source \n",
    "code based on previously established designs or algorithms. It involves writing clear, well-documented syntax \n",
    "that can be interpreted by a computer to perform tasks and solve problems as required. The focus here would \n",
    "primarily lie with understanding how different languages operate (syntax), using libraries effectively etc., \n",
    "while the broader aspects such as debugging techniques, planning strategies might not come into play often \n",
    "during this phase unless you're writing code for specific testing scenarios or optimizing a program to run \n",
    "faster which involves advanced programming knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how these two can interact in real-world scenario: A software engineer first understands \n",
    "the user requirements and creates algorithms (programming). Then, they write down corresponding source codes \n",
    "using their chosen language(coding), test them for errors or bugs, refine as necessary through iterations, \n",
    "document everything along with writing comments to explain certain sections of code. This continuous process \n",
    "embodies both programming and coding tasks working together in a harmonized manner throughout the software \n",

    "It's important to note that even though these terms are often used interchangeably, understanding their \n",
